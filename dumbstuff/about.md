About Another Axiom:
Another Axiom is a VR development team. Our passion is building Diegetic Virtual Realities. Instead of treating our world like a video game, we are building Orion Drift to make it feel like itâ€™s a plausible, alternate space that could exist if the rules of reality were just a little bit different.  People come away from our world with real dreams and memories of having been there with their friends.

We are a flat organization that believes that everyone contributes to our products in their own way - That everyone should be encouraged to explore and participate in all aspects of game development with their own unique point-of-view to help us build a diverse product.
